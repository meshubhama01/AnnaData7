The connection between the app and the backend hosted locally
as this is the prototype only we are not creating an online server.
It is developed using python GUI and socket programming.

Working:-Connectionport provides a way to transfer a data from one windows client to another using 
either wired or wireless connection.For wireless connection you must have wifi adapter installed and enabled.

In case of wired connection you have to provide the details of the server configuration and then you can connect
to the server,explore all its shared file and download it.All the downloaded file will be downloaded in the download
directory of this application. The shared data will be present in "record".

In case of wireless connection you just need to create a server if you are providing the file and
if you are client you just need to join on the listed available server and then you will be able to
get connected to the server.
